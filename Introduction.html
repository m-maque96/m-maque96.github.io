        I am great and knowledgeable in computer hardware. My skills in mathematics
        and science have helped me to excel in my classes. I am currently a senior in
        North Carolina A&T State University. I have had many jobs in the past, but the one
        job that was relevant to my field was Best Buy Geek Squad. I was able to help
        customers with technical issues in their mobile devices.

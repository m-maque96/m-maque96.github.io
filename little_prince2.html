    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u>
    <font>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</font> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
    his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
    <span>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>

    <span>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping hee, is his loyalty to a flower
        --the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like te flame of a lamp, even whe he is asleep..."</span>
    And I felt him to be more fragile still. <u style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt the need of protecting
him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
